# nfl-score-rss-feed
RSS feed showing live scores of NFL games. Only shows games for the current day that have already started.

Entries have an id that's a hash of the team names, home / away score, year, and week number, so each and every update in score shows as a unique item.

Hook into [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) for cool integrations. Demo [here](https://basalt-fifth.glitch.me/?teams=).
